ORI concurred with the factual findings as set forth in the ABL report, and finds that Mr. Constantoulakis committed scientific misconduct by falsifying and fabricating data in biomedical research supported by a contract with the National Cancer Institute and by misrepresenting his academic credentials for purposes of his employment under the contract. Mr. Constantoulakis accepted the misconduct finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which Mr. Constantoulakis will not apply for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for a five-year period beginning August 2, 1994.    One published paper (Science: 259:1314-1318) which contained data that was not reproducible has been retracted (Science: 264:492).FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:Director, Division of Research Investigations, Office of Research Integrity, 301-443-5330.Lyle W.

Records schedules identify records of sufficient value to warrant preservation in the National Archives of the United States.

Notice is published for records schedules that (1) propose the destruction of records not previously authorized for disposal, or (2) reduce the retention period for records already authorized for disposal.

      " u'full_text': u'Statement from a Treasury Spokesperson on CMS Announcement Last Week about 1095-A Forms:\\n\\n2/24/2015\\n\\nLast week, CMS announced that about 20 percent of the tax filers who purchased\\r\\nhealth insurance from the federal Marketplace received statements (or form\\r\\n1095As) that include an incorrect piece of information. CMS released\\r\\ndetailed information about the error, which is available here.Treasury estimates that\\r\\napproximately 50,000 tax filers (or less than 0.05% of total tax filers)\\r\\nalready have filed their taxes using these incorrect form 1095As. We have\\r\\nconcluded that these individuals do not need to file amended returns. The\\r\\nIRS will not pursue the collection of any additional taxes from these\\r\\nindividuals based on updated information in the corrected forms.\\r\\nNonetheless, some individuals may choose to file amended returns. A\\r\\ntax filer is likely to benefit from amending if the 2015 monthly premium for\\r\\nhis or her second lowest cost Silver plan (or \\u201cbenchmark\\u201d plan) is less than\\r\\nthe 2014 premium. For example, if a filer\\u2019s original form lists a\\r\\nbenchmark premium of $100 and her updated form lists a premium of $200, it may\\r\\nbe in her interest to refile. Individuals may want to consult with their\\r\\ntax preparers to determine if they would benefit from filing amended returns.\\r\\nAs CMS announced last week, affected individuals who have not yet filed\\r\\ntheir taxes should wait to file until they receive their corrected forms.\\r\\n###',\n",

      " u'full_text': u'Statement from a Treasury Spokesperson on CMS Announcement Last Week about 1095-A Forms:\\n\\n2/24/2015\\n\\nLast week, CMS announced that about 20 percent of the tax filers who purchased\\r\\nhealth insurance from the federal Marketplace received statements (or form\\r\\n1095As) that include an incorrect piece of information. CMS released\\r\\ndetailed information about the error, which is available here.Treasury estimates that\\r\\napproximately 50,000 tax filers (or less than 0.05% of total tax filers)\\r\\nalready have filed their taxes using these incorrect form 1095As. We have\\r\\nconcluded that these individuals do not need to file amended returns. The\\r\\nIRS will not pursue the collection of any additional taxes from these\\r\\nindividuals based on updated information in the corrected forms.\\r\\nNonetheless, some individuals may choose to file amended returns. A\\r\\ntax filer is likely to benefit from amending if the 2015 monthly premium for\\r\\nhis or her second lowest cost Silver plan (or \\u201cbenchmark\\u201d plan) is less than\\r\\nthe 2014 premium. For example, if a filer\\u2019s original form lists a\\r\\nbenchmark premium of $100 and her updated form lists a premium of $200, it may\\r\\nbe in her interest to refile. Individuals may want to consult with their\\r\\ntax preparers to determine if they would benefit from filing amended returns.\\r\\nAs CMS announced last week, affected individuals who have not yet filed\\r\\ntheir taxes should wait to file until they receive their corrected forms.\\r\\n###',\n",

      " u'full_text': u'FTC Approves Final Consent Orders in Two Deceptive Auto Advertising Cases For Release May 29, 2015 Tags: deceptive/misleading conduct Automobiles Bureau of Consumer Protection Consumer Protection Advertising and Marketing Following a public comment period, the Federal Trade Commission has approved final consent orders involving two auto dealers that deceptively advertised the sale, financing and leasing of their vehicles.Under the settlement orders, Jim Burke Nissan of Birmingham, Ala., and Ross Nissan of El Monte, Calif., are prohibited from misrepresenting in any advertisement the cost to purchase or lease a vehicle, or any other material fact about the price, sale, financing, or leasing of a vehicle. The consent orders also address the alleged Truth in Lending Act and Consumer Leasing Act violations by requiring the dealerships to clearly and conspicuously disclose terms required by these credit and lease laws.The Jim Burke order also prohibits the auto dealer from representing that a discount, rebate, bonus, incentive or price is available unless it is available to all consumers or the qualification terms are clearly and conspicuously disclosed.These cases were part of the FTC\\u2019s nationwide and cross-border auto sweep Operation Ruse Control, which was announced in March 2015. The Commission announced a final consent with National Payment Network, Inc., a company involved in the sweep that deceptively advertised its add-on biweekly auto payment plan, earlier this month.The Commission votes approving the final orders were 5-0.The Federal Trade Commission works for consumers to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, and unfair business practices and to provide information to help spot, stop, and avoid them. To file a complaint in English or Spanish, visit the FTC\\u2019s online Complaint Assistant or call 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357). The FTC enters complaints into Consumer Sentinel, a secure, online database available to more than 2,000 civil and criminal law enforcement agencies in the U.S. and abroad.

      " u'abstract': u\"The Farm Service Agency (FSA) is amending the disaster set- aside program requirement to allow farm borrowers to set aside portions of payments that could not be made as scheduled due to a natural disaster as declared by the President or Secretary of Agriculture during 1998, or because of low commodity prices during 1998. Applications for set-aside due to 1998 low commodity prices must be received on or before August 31, 1999. Borrowers who have loans with set-aside payments as of the publication date of this regulation may set aside a second payment on the same loans if determined eligible based on criteria established by this rule. To receive consideration for a second set-aside due to a natural disaster, the borrower's request must be received within 8 months from the date of the disaster designation, in accordance with 7 CFR part 1945, subpart A. The impact of these provisions will allow the agency to serve farmers who have experienced losses due to a natural disaster or low commodity prices during 1998 in an efficient and timely manner while helping them stay in business.\",\n",

      " u'text_content': u\"<p>SUMMARY: The NCUA Board proposes removing its rule governing safe deposit box service. This revision will eliminate an unnecessary section from the regulations.DATES: Comments must be received on or before March 5, 1999.ADDRESSES: Direct comments to Becky Baker, Secretary of the Board. Mail or hand-deliver comments to: National Credit Union Administration, 1775 Duke Street, Alexandria, Virginia 22314-3428. You may fax comments to (703) 518-6319. Please send comments by one method only.FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: Regina M. Metz, Staff Attorney, Division of Operations, Office of General Counsel, at the above address or telephone: (703) 518-6540.SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:A. Background    NCUA has a policy of continually reviewing its regulations to ``update, clarify and simplify existing regulations and eliminate redundant and unnecessary provisions.'' Interpretive Rulings and Policy Statement (IRPS) 87-2, Developing and Reviewing Government Regulations. Our review of Sec. 701.30 of NCUA's regulations has revealed that this section is an unnecessary provision.B. Proposed Rule    The proposed rule removes the section of the regulations regarding safe deposit box service. 12 CFR 701.30. The NCUA Board proposes removing this section to streamline the publication of the regulations. The deletion of Sec. 701.30 does not affect the authority of federal credit unions to offer safe deposit box service.C. Section 701.30 Analysis    Section 701.30 of NCUA's regulations provides that a federal credit union may lease safe deposit boxes to its members. The Board recommends removing Sec. 701.30 because it is no longer necessary. Under the Federal Credit Union Act (the Act), federal credit unions have the power to exercise incidental powers that are necessary or requisite to enable them to carry on effectively the business for which they are incorporated. 12 U.S.C. 1757(17). Federal credit unions may lease safe deposit boxes to their members as part of routine services that federal credit unions can provide. The removal of Sec. 701.30 would not affect this incidental authority.D. Regulatory Procedures1. Regulatory Flexibility Act    The Regulatory Flexibility Act requires NCUA to prepare an analysis to describe any significant economic impact any proposed regulation may have on a substantial number of small entities (primarily those under $1 million in assets). NCUA has determined and certifies that this proposed rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small credit unions. Accordingly, NCUA has determined that a Regulatory Flexibility analysis is not required.2. Paperwork Reduction Act    This proposed rule to remove Sec. 701.30 does not involve a collection of information under the Paperwork Reduction Act. Accordingly, NCUA has determined that a Paperwork Reduction analysis is not required.3. Executive Order 12612    Executive Order 12612 requires NCUA to consider the effect of its actions on state interests. The proposed rule is to remove a current regulation that applies to federal credit unions, not federally insured state chartered credit unions. Therefore, NCUA has determined that the proposed rule does not constitute a ``significant regulatory action'' for purposes of the Executive Order.[[Page 58]]List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701    Credit unions, Safe deposit box service.    By the National Credit Union Administration Board on December 17, 1998.Becky Baker,Secretary of the Board.    For the reasons set forth in the preamble, the National Credit Union Administration proposes to amend 12 CFR part 701 as follows:PART 701--ORGANIZATION AND OPERATION OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS    1. The authority citation for part 701 continues to read as follows:    Authority: 12 U.S.C. 1752(5), 1755, 1756, 1757, 1759, 1761a, 1761b, 1766, 1767, 1782, 1784, 1787, and 1789. Section 701.6 is also authorized by 31 U.S.C. 3717. Section 701.31 is also authorized by 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq., 42 U.S.C. 1861 and 42 U.S.C. 3601-3610. Section 701.35 is also authorized by 42 U.S.C. 4311-4312.Sec. 701.30  [Removed]    2.

ORI concurred with the factual findings as set forth in the ABL report, and finds that Mr. Constantoulakis committed scientific misconduct by falsifying and fabricating data in biomedical research supported by a contract with the National Cancer Institute and by misrepresenting his academic credentials for purposes of his employment under the contract. Mr. Constantoulakis accepted the misconduct finding and agreed to a Voluntary Exclusion and Settlement Agreement under which Mr. Constantoulakis will not apply for Federal grant or contract funds and will not serve on PHS advisory committees, boards, or peer review groups for a five-year period beginning August 2, 1994.

The final rulemaking implements provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (Dodd-Frank Act). The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 amended the obligations of DCMs under the CEA On July 21, 2010, Congress passed the Dodd-Frank Act, which amended the Commodity Exchange Act. Section 735 of the Dodd-Frank Act amended Section 5 of the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) by: \\uf0b7 Eliminating the eight criteria for designation as a contract market under Section 5(b) of the CEA; \\uf0b7 Amending most of the core principles, including incorporating into the core principles most of the former designation criteria; and \\uf0b7 Adding five new core principles: Core Principle 13 (Disciplinary Procedures), Core Principle 20 (System Safeguards), Core Principle 21 (Financial Resources), Core Principle 22 (Diversity of Boards of Directors), and Core Principle 23 (Securities and Exchange Commission). Section 723 of the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 2(h)(8) of the CEA to require that the execution of certain swaps, those that are subject to the mandatory clearing requirement of CEA Section 2(h), occur on DCMs or Swap Execution Facilities (SEFs), except where no DCM or SEF makes the swap available for trading. The Commission\\u2019s new and amended rules, guidance and acceptable practices govern the obligations of DCMs under the CEA The new and amended rules, guidance and acceptable practices implement the new and amended 23 core principles, and incorporate the trading and execution of swaps on DCMs. The rulemaking codifies rules and provides guidance and acceptable practices governing the obligations of DCMs to comply with the applicable provisions of the CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, including the 23 core principles under Section 5(d) of the CEA. Specifically, the rules, guidance and acceptable practices govern the general obligations of DCMs under the amended core principles, including but not limited to: \\uf0b7 Financial information and resource requirements; \\uf0b7 Compliance obligations; \\uf0b7 Operational capabilities; Commodity Futures Trading Commission \\u2666 Office of Public Affairs \\u2666 202-418-5080 \\uf0b7 Surveillance obligations; and \\uf0b7 Trading and products requirements. In addition, the rules, guidance and acceptable practices govern the obligations of DCMs with respect to the trading and execution of swaps, in addition to futures and options contracts.',\n",

      " u'full_text': u'FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE 2015-34 Washington D.C., Feb. 13, 2015 \\u2014 The Securities and Exchange Commission today charged a purported hedge fund manager in New York City with stealing money from his investors. The SEC alleges that Moazzam \\u201cMark\\u201d Malik falsely claimed to be operating a hedge fund with approximately $100 million in assets under management, and he solicited investors with promises of consistently high returns. Although he raised $840,774 from investors, his fund never made real investments and never held more than $90,177 in assets as Malik continually withdrew the cash and spent it as his own. Despite repeated demands from investors for the return of their money, Malik has flatly refused or delayed the bulk of their redemption requests. He allegedly went so far as to create a fictitious fund employee who sent one investor an e-mail claiming that Malik had died. \\u201cBy pretending to be a successful hedge fund manager, Malik conned investors into bankrolling his lavish lifestyle,\\u201d said Andrew M. Calamari, Director of the SEC\\u2019s New York Regional Office. \\u201cBesides luxury travel, dining, and jewelry, investor funds paid for Malik\\u2019s continuing education courses at Harvard and his subscription to a matrimonial matching website.\\u201d According to the SEC\\u2019s complaint filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Malik has been continuing to solicit investors amid the redemption requests. His fund has changed its name several times since he created it in 2010. Malik initially called it Wall Street Creative Partners before changing it to Seven Sages Capital LP and then American Bridge Investment Group LLC. Most recently it has been known as Wolf Hedge LLC. Malik described his fund as \\u201ca privately held Global Investment Management firm dedicated to the individuals and institutions around the world.\\u201d The SEC alleges that Malik created a fictitious \\u201cAmanda Ebert\\u201d who was identified with a title of \\u201cInvestor Relations, Wolf Hedge LLC\\u201d in e-mail communications with several investors. Malik included in the e-mails a purported photograph of Ebert that he copied off the Internet. The real-life woman in the photo does not know Malik and never authorized the use of her image in the e-mails. The SEC\\u2019s complaint charges Malik and his fund with violating Sections 5(a), 5(c) and 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint also charges Malik with violations of Sections 206(1), 206(2) and 206(4) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Rule 206(4)-8. The SEC seeks a temporary restraining order to freeze the assets of Malik and his fund and prohibit them from committing further violations of the federal securities laws. The SEC seeks a final judgment ordering them to disgorge their ill-gotten gains plus prejudgment interest and penalties. The SEC\\u2019s investigation is continuing and is being conducted by Gerald Gross, James Hanson, Paul Gizzi, and Debbie Chan of the New York office. The case is being supervised by Sanjay Wadhwa. The SEC appreciates the assistance of the New York State Attorney General\\u2019s Office. ###',\n",

Kelly, a former gasoline trader for BP Products North America Inc. (BPPNA), for attempting to manipulate the price spread between the November and December 2002 unleaded gasoline futures contracts traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) on October 31, 2002, the last day of trading for the November 2002 unleaded gasoline futures contract.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe October 25, 2007 order imposed a $400,000 civil monetary penalty.  The order also imposed a prohibition on Kelly from applying for registration, engaging in any activity requiring registration, or acting as a principal of any registered entity or person.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe order finds that Kelly was primarily responsible for obtaining physical, finished gasoline as well as components for gasoline for BPPNA\\u2019s northeast commercial needs.  According to the order, unleaded gasoline was in short supply in October 2002 and early November 2002, and Kelly was aware of the shortage.  The order finds that despite the fact that BPPNA held a long position of 1,352 November 2002 unleaded gasoline contracts \\u2013 52 more than its stated commercial need of 1,300 contracts \\u2013 Kelly bought an additional 720 November 2002 unleaded gasoline contracts through the course of the day on October 31, 2002.  The Commission found that Kelly engaged in this conduct with the intent to affect the price spread between the November and December 2002 NYMEX unleaded gasoline futures contracts.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe Commission wishes to thank the New York Mercantile Exchange for its support and assistance with this matter.  The following CFTC Division of Enforcement staff members are primarily responsible for this case: John W. Dunfee, Paul G. Hayeck, Joan M. Manley, Lael Campbell, Mary Kaminski, and Ed Riccobene.\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\t\\r\\n\\t              Media Contacts\\r\\n  \\r\\n               \\r\\n                    \\tIanthe Zabel202-418-5080\\r\\n                    \\tDennis Holden202-418-5088\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Updated: October 25, 2007',\n",

Program requirements for the Federal crop insurance program are the same for all producers regardless of the size of their farming operation. For instance, all producers are required to submit an application and acreage report to establish their insurance guarantees and compute premium amounts, and all producers are required to submit a notice of loss and production information to determine the amount of an indemnity payment in the event of an insured cause of crop loss. Whether a producer has 10 acres or 1,000 acres, there is no difference in the kind of information collected. To ensure crop insurance is available to small entities, the Federal Crop Insurance Act authorizes FCIC to waive collection of administrative fees from limited resource farmers. FCIC believes this waiver helps to ensure that small entities are given the same opportunities as large entities to manage their risks through the use of crop insurance. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been prepared since this regulation does not have an impact on small entities, and therefore, this regulation is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (<a class=\"usc external\" href=\"http://api.fdsys.gov/link?collection=uscode&amp;title=5&amp;year=mostrecent&amp;section=605&amp;type=usc&amp;link-type=html\" target=\"_blank\">5 U.S.C. 605</a>).</p>\\n        </div>\\n<div class=\"header_column\"><h2 class=\"\" id=\"h-14\">Federal Assistance Program <a href=\"#table_of_contents\" class=\"back_to_top\">Back to Top</a>\\n</h2></div>\\n<div class=\"body_column\">\\n        <p data-page=\"20407\" id=\"p-13\">This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450.</p>\\n        </div>\\n<div class=\"header_column\"><h2 class=\"\" id=\"h-15\">Executive Order 12372 <a href=\"#table_of_contents\" class=\"back_to_top\">Back to Top</a>\\n</h2></div>\\n<div class=\"body_column\">\\n        <p data-page=\"20407\" id=\"p-14\">This program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which require intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.

The commenters were an insurance service organization and a producer association.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-19\">The public comments received regarding the proposed rule and FCIC\\'s responses to the comments are as follows:</p>\\n        <h3 class=\"\" id=\"h-19\">Macadamia Tree Crop Insurance Provisions</h3>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-20\">Section 1</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-20\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter agrees with the proposal to add definitions for &ldquo;damaged&rdquo; and &ldquo;scaffold limb.&rdquo;</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-21\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC thanks the commenter for its review and its support of the addition of these two definitions.</p>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-21\">Section 2</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-22\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the first sentence in redesignated paragraph (a) states that optional units by legal description or by irrigated/non-irrigated practices are not applicable; and the second sentence states that &ldquo;. . . Optional units may be established ONLY if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement&rdquo; [emphasis added]. The commenter states that neither sentence addresses the possibility of optional units for organic and conventional practices, which is allowed according to section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. As written, this provision appears to mean that separate optional units for organic and conventional acreage would be possible only if they happen to be on non-contiguous land or unless allowed by written agreement. If that is the intention, it would be clearer to include &ldquo;organic practices&rdquo; in the first sentence as not applicable. If it is not intended to exclude optional units by organic/conventional practices, the second sentence should be revised to clarify that optional units by non-contiguous land may be &ldquo;in addition to&rdquo; the optional units by organic/conventional allowed in section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-23\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC intends for optional units to be allowed on acreage located on non-contiguous land or on acreage grown and insured under an organic farming practice. FCIC does not intend to require that optional units distinguished by organic and conventional practices must also be located on non-contiguous land. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-24\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the &ldquo;Background&rdquo; explains that the proposal to remove the 80-acre minimum requirement for optional units is because most macadamia tree orchards are smaller than that, and the other proposed changes (requiring a clear and discernible break, and records) &ldquo;. . . will mitigate any potential abuse from this change.&rdquo; The commenter has no objection to this change.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-25\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter and thanks it for its support. FCIC also notes that the planned removal of this 80-acre optional unit minimum requirement was inadvertently described in the proposed rule summary. The discussion of this requirement removal was also described in specific detail under the description of changes for this rule at Section 2. Therefore, FCIC removed this inadvertent reference from the final rule summary because specific mention of this proposal in the proposed rule summary was inadvertent and duplicative. This removal of the duplicative language from the proposed rule summary does not affect the commenter\\'s agreement with the proposal: FCIC continues to agree with the commenter, and the proposal as originally proposed has been adopted.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-26\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states if the current section 2(a) is deleted as proposed, then Basic Provisions sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) will apply, meaning optional units will require a clear and discernible break, and acceptable and verifiable records. The commenter has no objection to this change.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-27\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter that by deleting section 2(a) of the Macadamia Tree Crop Provisions, sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions will apply. FCIC thanks the commenter for its support.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-28\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the proposed change would require that optional units must have a &ldquo;clear and discernable break between optional units.&rdquo; This is clarified further by stating &ldquo;optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.&rdquo; There is no clear definition of what constitutes a &ldquo;clear and discernable break.&rdquo; It does disqualify optional units determined by &ldquo;section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices.&rdquo;</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-29\">Without a clear specification for what actually fits their definition for the &ldquo;clear and discernable break,&rdquo; there is great potential for a broad interpretation from the Risk Management Agency that would ultimately prohibit larger operations from using optional units at all. Since large operations have significantly varied conditions over the span of their operations that can cause production loss over only certain sections (such as differences in rainfall, elevation, soil-type, disease and pest-incidence, etc.), optional units are important and necessary to provide operations with some security to protect from losses. Without the optional units, an operation becomes far more vulnerable, since only significant orchard-wide production losses would ever qualify for a claim. It becomes financially infeasible to even have insurance for many producers with such limitations. This rule change should not pass without explicit definitions of what would qualify as a &ldquo;clear and discernible break.&rdquo;</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-30\">Based on how the insurance companies had treated boundaries in the past with regards to the formation of optional units, a clear and discernible break should be defined by a designated production area (for instance, a block or field) with a set acreage that has enough production statistics for the APH to qualify for insurance. For instance, in our operation, we have had the same fields that have remained consistent since planting. Each field should be able to qualify as a block, as production statistics are kept for each field separately.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20408\" id=\"p-31\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter that the proposed change to remove paragraph (a) requires optional units to have a clear and discernible break. Paragraph (a) states sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable. These sections of the Basic Provisions state, among other things, that the crop must be planted in a manner such that there is a clear and discernible break between optional units. By removing paragraph (a), sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions now become applicable. Under the current policy, insureds who utilize optional units can manipulate their unit boundaries to maximize indemnities because there is<span data-page=\"20409\" class=\"printed_page\" id=\"page-20409\"> </span>no current requirement for discernible breaks between units. FCIC believes this requirement will minimize program abuse as it relates to unit division. Based on a previous comment, FCIC has revised Section 2 to clarify that optional units are allowed by non-contiguous land or by organic and conventional acreage, thereby giving producers multiple options to insure their acreage under optional units. FCIC does not define &ldquo;clear and discernible break&rdquo; in its policy; however, in general, when a term is not specifically defined in the policy, its common or ordinary meaning may be applicable as found in a standard dictionary. Examples of a clear and discernible break are highways, railroads and rivers. No change has been made.</p>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-22\">Section 7</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-32\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter recommends deleting the first comma in the following sentence: &ldquo;In lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop . . .&rdquo; The commenter says this change will be consistent with a similar change proposed in section 8 of the Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-33\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter. The comma is not necessary and its removal does not change the meaning of the provision. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly.</p>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-23\">Section 10</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-34\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the proposed rule adds a phrase about destroyed trees in the following phrase so it would read: &ldquo;. . . allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning any damaged trees, removing any damaged trees, or removing any destroyed trees.&rdquo; This can be left as written, but consider if either of these alternatives might be preferable:</p>\\n        <ul class=\"bullets\">\\n<li data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-35\"> &ldquo;. . . before pruning or removing any damaged trees, or removing any destroyed trees.&rdquo; This keeps the current wording about the two possible actions for damaged trees, and adds the new phrase about removing destroyed trees.</li>\\n        <li data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-36\"> &ldquo;. . . before pruning any damaged trees, or removing any damaged or destroyed trees.&rdquo; This would put &ldquo;pruning&rdquo; in one phrase (applying only to damaged trees) and &ldquo;removing&rdquo; in another (whether the trees are damaged or destroyed).</li>\\n</ul>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-37\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC appreciates the recommendations. However, FCIC believes its proposed language offers the option of the possibilities least likely to create misunderstanding because each action word is individually paired with the tree type (damaged vs. destroyed) for which the action is prohibited.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-38\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states that, concerning halting of cleanup following tree damage, during the most recent experience with Hurricane Iselle, it took the insurance companies around two weeks, and in some cases longer, to fly appraisers to Hawaii to assess storm damage. For any agricultural operation, especially during harvest season, waiting that long to remove damaged trees, branches, and other debris can pose not only safety hazards, but can also limit movement throughout orchards and can lead to crop loss due to the inability of harvest equipment and crews to safely traverse through the areas of damage.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-39\">The majority of the insurance companies are located on the continental United States, so they typically wait to hear from all of the insured operations in Hawaii before deploying loss adjusters. This is due to the distance and the large expense of sending people back and forth. In light of these limitations, it is not practical or fair to make farms wait so long before cleaning up. The alternatives to these rule changes would be either to not change this rule or to add to the change a requirement for tree loss appraisers to be on-site no later than three days after notice of a major crop or tree loss.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-40\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC understands that it may take insurance companies additional time to travel to Hawaii than to travel within the continental United States. This inspection requirement is consistent with the provisions in other Crop Provisions, such as the Hawaii Tropical Tree Crop Provisions, which also provide coverage for crops in Hawaii. Travel could be difficult after a catastrophic event, such as a named storm. Therefore, a regulatory provision always requiring insurance company presence on-site within three days after notice of a loss is inappropriate in part because not all circumstances will always allow such Loss Adjuster to arrive within that timeframe. A three-day arrival expectation may be appropriate in some, though not necessarily all, instances of loss. Insurance companies are required to arrive onsite after receiving a notice of loss within appropriate time frames. For example, the current Loss Adjustment Manual (LAM), in paragraph 41(A)(3), provides guidance that insurance companies must assign notice of damage to adjusters as quickly as possible to assure timely service to the insured. FCIC will, as it generally does in widespread loss situations, monitor the performance of and loss adjustment service provided by insurance companies in responding to a loss event.</p>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-24\">Section 11</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-41\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states with the example added in section 11(b)(4), consider if the parenthetical example in section 11(b)(3)(iii) is still useful or if it could be deleted. If it is kept, consider deleting the phrase &ldquo;. . . specified in section 11(b)(3) . . .&rdquo; since it is part of 11(b)(3).</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-42\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> Given that no change to this provision was proposed, and the public was not provided an opportunity to comment, FCIC declines to adopt the recommendation in the final rule. No change has been made.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-43\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the calculations in paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(ii) and (iii) do not appear to correspond to the description of those steps in paragraph (b)(3) because the example includes additional calculations as well. The example appears to work out correctly, but it might be worth considering the following:</p>\\n        <ul class=\"bullets\">\\n<li data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-44\"> In paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(ii), if the calculation of the &ldquo;actual percent of loss&rdquo; should be identified as such, or included in the introductory paragraph instead; and/or</li>\\n        <li data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-45\"> In paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(iii), if the calculation of the dollar amount of loss [&ldquo;. . . and $58,500 total amount of insurance &times; 6.0 percent loss = $3,510 loss&rdquo;] should be better identified [since step (3) says only to divide the previous result by the coverage level] or perhaps moved to be part of the final step (4).</li>\\n</ul>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-46\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter that the steps in paragraph (b) do not correspond with the calculations in the settlement of claim example. FCIC agrees with both of the commenters\\' recommendations to clarify the steps in paragraph (b). FCIC has revised the provisions as recommended, has made additional clarifications in the steps in paragraph (b), and has revised the settlement of claim example at redesignated paragraph (b)(5) to reflect the revisions in paragraph (b).</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-47\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter recommends, in the introduction of paragraph (b)(4) of the settlement of claim example, to add a hyphen in &ldquo;Thirty five trees. . . .&rdquo; so it reads, &ldquo;Thirty-five trees . . .&rdquo;</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20409\" id=\"p-48\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter and has revised the provisions in redesignated paragraph (b)(5) accordingly.<span data-page=\"20410\" class=\"printed_page\" id=\"page-20410\"> </span>\\n        </p>\\n        <h3 class=\"\" id=\"h-25\">Macadamia Nut Crop Insurance Provisions</h3>\\n        <h4 class=\"\" id=\"h-26\">Section 1</h4>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-49\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter recommends correcting the spelling of &ldquo;floatation&rdquo; to &ldquo;flotation&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;floaters.&rdquo;</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-50\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter, even though &ldquo;floatation&rdquo; is an accepted spelling of &ldquo;flotation,&rdquo; and has revised the provisions accordingly.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-51\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter states the definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; is revised to say that it excludes floaters and peewees, which FCIC claims are terms commonly used in the Macadamia industry. While the terms are sometimes used, there are some issues with the suggested use of these terms and how the FCIC defines them. For starters, there was no consultation with processors or husking operations to ascertain what the industry-accepted definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; is. Furthermore, the term &ldquo;floater&rdquo; has a different definition to the Macadamia nut industry than is suggested by FCIC and in actuality is seldom used. This is primarily because float grading is not a common practice for Macadamia nut husking or processing and when it is employed, it is typically performed at a different stage in the husking operation than what FCIC has suggested in their interpretation of the rules. It is believed that the reason that the FCIC is recommending this change is in response to a claim dispute, in order to validate FCIC\\'s stance against the industry standards. The commenter states FCIC would essentially create an ultimatum for the industry that producers would either need to request their processors to change their processing methods or face the penalty of not qualifying for crop insurance. The cost of making infrastructural changes in order to comply with these proposed changes would be high, so many processors may be discouraged from making these changes, given that many only purchase nuts from producers and have no stake in the rules governing crop insurance. The rule change would essentially create an impossible standard for producers to ever qualify for crop insurance.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-52\">Though it was stated in the past that the industry was consulted in the development of the Macadamia nut policy, the policy as it is currently written does not reflect this. It is recommended that (1) the definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; be amended, (2) the industry be given an opportunity to provide input on how things operate in Hawaii, and (3) how the policy could be amended to better represent reality.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-53\">The revision to the definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; should be according to what is common to the industry. Wet in-shell (WIS) nuts are the result after husking has been implemented; this WIS weight is considered a gross number; the &ldquo;extraneous materials&rdquo; percentage is used to calculate the amount to subtract from the WIS number to come up with a net WIS. The &ldquo;extraneous materials&rdquo; percentage or trash is calculated in a quality analysis lab using samples obtained from the husking operation. While sample collection may vary from one operation to the next, this method of determining the net WIS is basically the same across the industry.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-54\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC disagrees with the commenter\\'s understanding of changes to the &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; definition. The language FCIC proposes to incorporate in the Crop Provisions definition is derived from the Special Provisions as well as the Macadamia Nut Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook (LASH). The Special Provisions and LASH are part of the policy or are used to service the policy. FCIC is not changing the definition meaning by incorporating the Special Provisions and LASH statements into the definition. The Special Provisions statement has been in effect since the 2006 crop year and the LASH definition has been in effect since the 2005 crop year.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-55\">The commenter says they believe the reason FCIC is recommending the change to the definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; is in response to a claim dispute, in order to validate FCIC\\'s stance against the industry standards. The commenter says FCIC would essentially create an ultimatum for the industry that producers would either need to request their processors to change their processing methods or face the penalty of not qualifying for crop insurance. The commenter says the change would essentially create an impossible standard for producers to ever qualify for crop insurance. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, FCIC is not making a substantial change to the definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell.&rdquo; The primary change is to incorporate language contained in the Special Provisions and LASH that are currently in effect and have been in effect since the 2006 and 2005 crop years, respectively. Since this change is not substantial, this definition has already existed in large part, and was required for use in policy servicing, FCIC does not agree that such change creates an ultimatum for producers.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-56\">Furthermore, FCIC\\'s definition of &ldquo;wet in-shell,&rdquo; as now updated, corresponds with the definition the commenter seeks for the industry concerns. The commenter says wet in-shell nuts are the result after husking has been implemented (gross weight) and the &ldquo;extraneous materials&rdquo; percentage or trash is used to calculate the amount that is subtracted from the gross weight. The difference between the gross weight and the &ldquo;extraneous materials&rdquo; percentage or trash is the wet in-shell net weight. FCIC\\'s definition says the wet in-shell weight is the weight after removal of the husk (gross weight) and excluding floaters and peewees (extraneous material or trash) but prior to being dried. The industry agrees FCIC should not include floaters and peewees in the wet in-shell weight for purposes of production to count, and refers to such floaters and peewees as &ldquo;trash&rdquo; or &ldquo;extraneous materials.&rdquo; FCIC understands the comment to assume FCIC requires all macadamia nut production to be float graded using water flotation for insurance purposes. However, this assumption is incorrect. Under the policy, float grading using water flotation is only one acceptable method of determining floaters to exclude from production to count. To clarify and specifically address the commenter\\'s concern regarding industry practices, FCIC has specifically added to the definition of wet in-shell, through the component definition of floaters, a reference that laboratory testing for floater determination is also acceptable as an alternative to float grading using water floatation. In sum, FCIC requires that the reported production must not include floaters and peewees, or, in other words, the weight of the trash, which the industry and FCIC now similarly define.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-57\">In the proposed rule, FCIC proposed to define the terms &ldquo;floaters&rdquo; and &ldquo;peewees&rdquo; because those terms are used in the Special Provisions statement and LASH definitions that were proposed for incorporation into the &ldquo;wet in-shell&rdquo; definition. Those terms were not previously defined within the Crop Provisions, but they were defined in the Macadamia Nut LASH. The LASH has contained those terms and their definitions since the 2005 crop year.</p>\\n\\n        <p data-page=\"20410\" id=\"p-58\">The proposed rule comment period is an opportunity for the public to provide input on changes FCIC proposes to make to the Crop Provisions. Interested parties are permitted to provide comments during that time. If the commenter had specific suggestions for recommended changes to this portion of the Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions, the commenter had an opportunity to provide specific proposed changes on this issue during the proposed rule comment period. However, FCIC has made an addition to the definition that<span data-page=\"20411\" class=\"printed_page\" id=\"page-20411\"> </span>will address the commenter\\'s industry concern.</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20411\" id=\"p-59\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Comment:</i> One commenter recommends deleting the comma in the phrase &ldquo;wet, in-shell pounds&rdquo; in the definition of &ldquo;production guarantee (per acre)&rdquo; to match the defined term of &ldquo;wet in-shell,&rdquo; as was done in sections 6(d) and 11(c).</p>\\n        <p data-page=\"20411\" id=\"p-60\">\\n          <i class=\"E-03\">Response:</i> FCIC agrees with the commenter that the comma should be removed from the sentence.

The commenter states that neither sentence addresses the possibility of optional units for organic and conventional practices, which is allowed according to section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. As written, this provision appears to mean that separate optional units for organic and conventional acreage would be possible only if they happen to be on non-contiguous land or unless allowed by written agreement. If that is the intention, it would be clearer to include &ldquo;organic practices&rdquo; in the first sentence as not applicable.

The intended effect of this action is to provide policy changes and to better meet the needs of the producers. The proposed changes will be effective for the 2016 and succeeding crop years for macadamia trees and for the 2017 and succeeding crop years for macadamia nuts. \\nDATES: \\nThis rule is effective May 18, 2015. \\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: \\nTim Hoffmann, Director, Product Administration and Standards Division, Risk Management Agency, United States Department of Agriculture, Beacon Facility, Stop 0812, Room 421, P.O. Box 419205, Kansas City, MO 64141-6205, telephone (816) 926-7730. \\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: \\nExecutive Order 12866 \\nThe Office of Management and Budget (OMB) has determined that this rule is not-significant for the purpose of Executive Order 12866 and, therefore, it has not been reviewed by OMB. \\nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1995 \\nPursuant to the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (44 U.S.C. chapter 35), the collections of information in this rule have been approved by OMB under control number 0563-0053. \\nE-Government Act Compliance \\nFCIC is committed to complying with the E-Government Act of 2002, to promote the use of the Internet and other information technologies to provide increased opportunities for citizen access to Government information and services, and for other purposes. \\nUnfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 \\nTitle II of the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (UMRA) establishes requirements for Federal agencies to assess the effects of their regulatory actions on State, local, and tribal governments and the private sector. This rule contains no Federal mandates (under the regulatory provisions of title II of the UMRA) for State, local, and tribal governments or the private sector. Therefore, this rule is not subject to the requirements of sections 202 and 205 of UMRA. \\nExecutive Order 13132 \\nIt has been determined under section 1(a) of Executive Order 13132, Federalism, that this rule does not have sufficient implications to warrant consultation with the States. The provisions contained in this rule will not have a substantial direct effect on States, or on the relationship between the national government and the States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among the various levels of government. \\nExecutive Order 13175 \\nThis rule has been reviewed in accordance with the requirements of Executive Order 13175, Consultation and Coordination with Indian Tribal Governments. The review reveals that this regulation will not have substantial and direct effects on Tribal governments and will not have significant Tribal implications. \\nRegulatory Flexibility Act \\nFCIC certifies that this regulation will not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Program requirements for the Federal crop insurance program are the same for all producers regardless of the size of their farming operation. For instance, all producers are required to submit an application and acreage report to establish their insurance guarantees and compute premium amounts, and all producers are required to submit a notice of loss and production information to determine the amount of an indemnity payment in the event of an insured cause of crop loss. Whether a producer has 10 acres or 1,000 acres, there is no difference in the kind of information collected. To ensure crop insurance is available to small entities, the Federal Crop Insurance Act authorizes FCIC to waive collection of administrative fees from limited resource farmers. FCIC believes this waiver helps to ensure that small entities are given the same opportunities as large entities to manage their risks through the use of crop insurance. A Regulatory Flexibility Analysis has not been prepared since this regulation does not have an impact on small entities, and therefore, this regulation is exempt from the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 605). \\nFederal Assistance Program \\nThis program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance under No. 10.450. \\nExecutive Order 12372 \\nThis program is not subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372, which require intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials. See the Notice related to 7 CFR part 3015, subpart V, published at 48 FR 29115, June 24, 1983. \\nExecutive Order 12988 \\nThis final rule has been reviewed in accordance with Executive Order 12988 on civil justice reform. The provisions of this rule will not have a retroactive effect. The provisions of this rule will preempt State and local laws to the extent such State and local laws are inconsistent herewith. With respect to any direct action taken by FCIC or action by FCIC to require the insurance provider to take specific action under the terms of the crop insurance policy, the administrative appeal provisions published at 7 CFR part 11 must be exhausted before any action against FCIC for judicial review may be brought. \\nEnvironmental Evaluation \\nThis action is not expected to have a significant economic impact on the quality of the human environment, health, or safety. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessment nor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed. \\nBackground \\nThis rule finalizes changes to the Common Crop Insurance Regulations (7 CFR part 457), Macadamia Tree Crop Insurance Provisions and Macadamia Nut Crop Insurance Provisions that were published by FCIC on August 1, 2014, as a notice of proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register at 79 FR 44719-44722. The public was afforded 60 days to submit comments after the regulation was published in the Federal Register . \\nA total of 23 comments were received from two commenters. The commenters were an insurance service organization and a producer association. \\nThe public comments received regarding the proposed rule and FCIC's responses to the comments are as follows: \\nMacadamia Tree Crop Insurance Provisions \\nSection 1 \\nComment: One commenter agrees with the proposal to add definitions for \\u201cdamaged\\u201d and \\u201cscaffold limb.\\u201d \\nResponse: FCIC thanks the commenter for its review and its support of the addition of these two definitions. \\nSection 2 \\nComment: One commenter states the first sentence in redesignated paragraph (a) states that optional units by legal description or by irrigated/non-irrigated practices are not applicable; and the second sentence states that \\u201c. . . Optional units may be established ONLY if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement\\u201d [emphasis added]. The commenter states that neither sentence addresses the possibility of optional units for organic and conventional practices, which is allowed according to section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. As written, this provision appears to mean that separate optional units for organic and conventional acreage would be possible only if they happen to be on non-contiguous land or unless allowed by written agreement. If that is the intention, it would be clearer to include \\u201corganic practices\\u201d in the first sentence as not applicable. If it is not intended to exclude optional units by organic/conventional practices, the second sentence should be revised to clarify that optional units by non-contiguous land may be \\u201cin addition to\\u201d the optional units by organic/conventional allowed in section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. \\nResponse: FCIC intends for optional units to be allowed on acreage located on non-contiguous land or on acreage grown and insured under an organic farming practice. FCIC does not intend to require that optional units distinguished by organic and conventional practices must also be located on non-contiguous land. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly. \\nComment: One commenter states the \\u201cBackground\\u201d explains that the proposal to remove the 80-acre minimum requirement for optional units is because most macadamia tree orchards are smaller than that, and the other proposed changes (requiring a clear and discernible break, and records) \\u201c. . . will mitigate any potential abuse from this change.\\u201d The commenter has no objection to this change. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter and thanks it for its support. FCIC also notes that the planned removal of this 80-acre optional unit minimum requirement was inadvertently described in the proposed rule summary. The discussion of this requirement removal was also described in specific detail under the description of changes for this rule at Section 2. Therefore, FCIC removed this inadvertent reference from the final rule summary because specific mention of this proposal in the proposed rule summary was inadvertent and duplicative. This removal of the duplicative language from the proposed rule summary does not affect the commenter's agreement with the proposal: FCIC continues to agree with the commenter, and the proposal as originally proposed has been adopted. \\nComment: One commenter states if the current section 2(a) is deleted as proposed, then Basic Provisions sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) will apply, meaning optional units will require a clear and discernible break, and acceptable and verifiable records. The commenter has no objection to this change. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that by deleting section 2(a) of the Macadamia Tree Crop Provisions, sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions will apply. FCIC thanks the commenter for its support. \\nComment: One commenter states the proposed change would require that optional units must have a \\u201cclear and discernable break between optional units.\\u201d This is clarified further by stating \\u201coptional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land.\\u201d There is no clear definition of what constitutes a \\u201cclear and discernable break.\\u201d It does disqualify optional units determined by \\u201csection, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices.\\u201d \\nWithout a clear specification for what actually fits their definition for the \\u201cclear and discernable break,\\u201d there is great potential for a broad interpretation from the Risk Management Agency that would ultimately prohibit larger operations from using optional units at all. Since large operations have significantly varied conditions over the span of their operations that can cause production loss over only certain sections (such as differences in rainfall, elevation, soil-type, disease and pest-incidence, etc.), optional units are important and necessary to provide operations with some security to protect from losses. Without the optional units, an operation becomes far more vulnerable, since only significant orchard-wide production losses would ever qualify for a claim. It becomes financially infeasible to even have insurance for many producers with such limitations. This rule change should not pass without explicit definitions of what would qualify as a \\u201cclear and discernible break.\\u201d \\nBased on how the insurance companies had treated boundaries in the past with regards to the formation of optional units, a clear and discernible break should be defined by a designated production area (for instance, a block or field) with a set acreage that has enough production statistics for the APH to qualify for insurance. For instance, in our operation, we have had the same fields that have remained consistent since planting. Each field should be able to qualify as a block, as production statistics are kept for each field separately. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that the proposed change to remove paragraph (a) requires optional units to have a clear and discernible break. Paragraph (a) states sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions are not applicable. These sections of the Basic Provisions state, among other things, that the crop must be planted in a manner such that there is a clear and discernible break between optional units. By removing paragraph (a), sections 34(b)(1), (3) and (4) of the Basic Provisions now become applicable. Under the current policy, insureds who utilize optional units can manipulate their unit boundaries to maximize indemnities because there is no current requirement for discernible breaks between units. FCIC believes this requirement will minimize program abuse as it relates to unit division. Based on a previous comment, FCIC has revised Section 2 to clarify that optional units are allowed by non-contiguous land or by organic and conventional acreage, thereby giving producers multiple options to insure their acreage under optional units. FCIC does not define \\u201cclear and discernible break\\u201d in its policy; however, in general, when a term is not specifically defined in the policy, its common or ordinary meaning may be applicable as found in a standard dictionary. Examples of a clear and discernible break are highways, railroads and rivers. No change has been made. \\nSection 7 \\nComment: One commenter recommends deleting the first comma in the following sentence: \\u201cIn lieu of the provisions in section 9 of the Basic Provisions, that prohibit insurance attaching to a crop planted with another crop . . .\\u201d The commenter says this change will be consistent with a similar change proposed in section 8 of the Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter. The comma is not necessary and its removal does not change the meaning of the provision. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly. \\nSection 10 \\nComment: One commenter states the proposed rule adds a phrase about destroyed trees in the following phrase so it would read: \\u201c. . . allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning any damaged trees, removing any damaged trees, or removing any destroyed trees.\\u201d This can be left as written, but consider if either of these alternatives might be preferable: \\n\\u2022 \\u201c. . . before pruning or removing any damaged trees, or removing any destroyed trees.\\u201d This keeps the current wording about the two possible actions for damaged trees, and adds the new phrase about removing destroyed trees. \\n\\u2022 \\u201c. . . before pruning any damaged trees, or removing any damaged or destroyed trees.\\u201d This would put \\u201cpruning\\u201d in one phrase (applying only to damaged trees) and \\u201cremoving\\u201d in another (whether the trees are damaged or destroyed). \\nResponse: FCIC appreciates the recommendations. However, FCIC believes its proposed language offers the option of the possibilities least likely to create misunderstanding because each action word is individually paired with the tree type (damaged vs. destroyed) for which the action is prohibited. \\nComment: One commenter states that, concerning halting of cleanup following tree damage, during the most recent experience with Hurricane Iselle, it took the insurance companies around two weeks, and in some cases longer, to fly appraisers to Hawaii to assess storm damage. For any agricultural operation, especially during harvest season, waiting that long to remove damaged trees, branches, and other debris can pose not only safety hazards, but can also limit movement throughout orchards and can lead to crop loss due to the inability of harvest equipment and crews to safely traverse through the areas of damage. \\nThe majority of the insurance companies are located on the continental United States, so they typically wait to hear from all of the insured operations in Hawaii before deploying loss adjusters. This is due to the distance and the large expense of sending people back and forth. In light of these limitations, it is not practical or fair to make farms wait so long before cleaning up. The alternatives to these rule changes would be either to not change this rule or to add to the change a requirement for tree loss appraisers to be on-site no later than three days after notice of a major crop or tree loss. \\nResponse: FCIC understands that it may take insurance companies additional time to travel to Hawaii than to travel within the continental United States. This inspection requirement is consistent with the provisions in other Crop Provisions, such as the Hawaii Tropical Tree Crop Provisions, which also provide coverage for crops in Hawaii. Travel could be difficult after a catastrophic event, such as a named storm. Therefore, a regulatory provision always requiring insurance company presence on-site within three days after notice of a loss is inappropriate in part because not all circumstances will always allow such Loss Adjuster to arrive within that timeframe. A three-day arrival expectation may be appropriate in some, though not necessarily all, instances of loss. Insurance companies are required to arrive onsite after receiving a notice of loss within appropriate time frames. For example, the current Loss Adjustment Manual (LAM), in paragraph 41(A)(3), provides guidance that insurance companies must assign notice of damage to adjusters as quickly as possible to assure timely service to the insured. FCIC will, as it generally does in widespread loss situations, monitor the performance of and loss adjustment service provided by insurance companies in responding to a loss event. \\nSection 11 \\nComment: One commenter states with the example added in section 11(b)(4), consider if the parenthetical example in section 11(b)(3)(iii) is still useful or if it could be deleted. If it is kept, consider deleting the phrase \\u201c. . . specified in section 11(b)(3) . . .\\u201d since it is part of 11(b)(3). \\nResponse: Given that no change to this provision was proposed, and the public was not provided an opportunity to comment, FCIC declines to adopt the recommendation in the final rule. No change has been made. \\nComment: One commenter states the calculations in paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(ii) and (iii) do not appear to correspond to the description of those steps in paragraph (b)(3) because the example includes additional calculations as well. The example appears to work out correctly, but it might be worth considering the following: \\n\\u2022 In paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(ii), if the calculation of the \\u201cactual percent of loss\\u201d should be identified as such, or included in the introductory paragraph instead; and/or \\n\\u2022 In paragraph (b)(4) at step (3)(iii), if the calculation of the dollar amount of loss [\\u201c. . . and $58,500 total amount of insurance \\xd7 6.0 percent loss = $3,510 loss\\u201d] should be better identified [since step (3) says only to divide the previous result by the coverage level] or perhaps moved to be part of the final step (4). \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that the steps in paragraph (b) do not correspond with the calculations in the settlement of claim example. FCIC agrees with both of the commenters' recommendations to clarify the steps in paragraph (b). FCIC has revised the provisions as recommended, has made additional clarifications in the steps in paragraph (b), and has revised the settlement of claim example at redesignated paragraph (b)(5) to reflect the revisions in paragraph (b). \\nComment: One commenter recommends, in the introduction of paragraph (b)(4) of the settlement of claim example, to add a hyphen in \\u201cThirty five trees. . . .\\u201d so it reads, \\u201cThirty-five trees . . .\\u201d \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter and has revised the provisions in redesignated paragraph (b)(5) accordingly. \\nMacadamia Nut Crop Insurance Provisions \\nSection 1 \\nComment: One commenter recommends correcting the spelling of \\u201cfloatation\\u201d to \\u201cflotation\\u201d in the definition of \\u201cfloaters.\\u201d \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter, even though \\u201cfloatation\\u201d is an accepted spelling of \\u201cflotation,\\u201d and has revised the provisions accordingly. \\nComment: One commenter states the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d is revised to say that it excludes floaters and peewees, which FCIC claims are terms commonly used in the Macadamia industry. While the terms are sometimes used, there are some issues with the suggested use of these terms and how the FCIC defines them. For starters, there was no consultation with processors or husking operations to ascertain what the industry-accepted definition of \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d is. Furthermore, the term \\u201cfloater\\u201d has a different definition to the Macadamia nut industry than is suggested by FCIC and in actuality is seldom used. This is primarily because float grading is not a common practice for Macadamia nut husking or processing and when it is employed, it is typically performed at a different stage in the husking operation than what FCIC has suggested in their interpretation of the rules. It is believed that the reason that the FCIC is recommending this change is in response to a claim dispute, in order to validate FCIC's stance against the industry standards. The commenter states FCIC would essentially create an ultimatum for the industry that producers would either need to request their processors to change their processing methods or face the penalty of not qualifying for crop insurance. The cost of making infrastructural changes in order to comply with these proposed changes would be high, so many processors may be discouraged from making these changes, given that many only purchase nuts from producers and have no stake in the rules governing crop insurance. The rule change would essentially create an impossible standard for producers to ever qualify for crop insurance. \\nThough it was stated in the past that the industry was consulted in the development of the Macadamia nut policy, the policy as it is currently written does not reflect this. It is recommended that (1) the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d be amended, (2) the industry be given an opportunity to provide input on how things operate in Hawaii, and (3) how the policy could be amended to better represent reality. \\nThe revision to the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d should be according to what is common to the industry. Wet in-shell (WIS) nuts are the result after husking has been implemented; this WIS weight is considered a gross number; the \\u201cextraneous materials\\u201d percentage is used to calculate the amount to subtract from the WIS number to come up with a net WIS. The \\u201cextraneous materials\\u201d percentage or trash is calculated in a quality analysis lab using samples obtained from the husking operation. While sample collection may vary from one operation to the next, this method of determining the net WIS is basically the same across the industry. \\nResponse: FCIC disagrees with the commenter's understanding of changes to the \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d definition. The language FCIC proposes to incorporate in the Crop Provisions definition is derived from the Special Provisions as well as the Macadamia Nut Loss Adjustment Standards Handbook (LASH). The Special Provisions and LASH are part of the policy or are used to service the policy. FCIC is not changing the definition meaning by incorporating the Special Provisions and LASH statements into the definition. The Special Provisions statement has been in effect since the 2006 crop year and the LASH definition has been in effect since the 2005 crop year. \\nThe commenter says they believe the reason FCIC is recommending the change to the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d is in response to a claim dispute, in order to validate FCIC's stance against the industry standards. The commenter says FCIC would essentially create an ultimatum for the industry that producers would either need to request their processors to change their processing methods or face the penalty of not qualifying for crop insurance. The commenter says the change would essentially create an impossible standard for producers to ever qualify for crop insurance. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, FCIC is not making a substantial change to the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell.\\u201d The primary change is to incorporate language contained in the Special Provisions and LASH that are currently in effect and have been in effect since the 2006 and 2005 crop years, respectively. Since this change is not substantial, this definition has already existed in large part, and was required for use in policy servicing, FCIC does not agree that such change creates an ultimatum for producers. \\nFurthermore, FCIC's definition of \\u201cwet in-shell,\\u201d as now updated, corresponds with the definition the commenter seeks for the industry concerns. The commenter says wet in-shell nuts are the result after husking has been implemented (gross weight) and the \\u201cextraneous materials\\u201d percentage or trash is used to calculate the amount that is subtracted from the gross weight. The difference between the gross weight and the \\u201cextraneous materials\\u201d percentage or trash is the wet in-shell net weight. FCIC's definition says the wet in-shell weight is the weight after removal of the husk (gross weight) and excluding floaters and peewees (extraneous material or trash) but prior to being dried. The industry agrees FCIC should not include floaters and peewees in the wet in-shell weight for purposes of production to count, and refers to such floaters and peewees as \\u201ctrash\\u201d or \\u201cextraneous materials.\\u201d FCIC understands the comment to assume FCIC requires all macadamia nut production to be float graded using water flotation for insurance purposes. However, this assumption is incorrect. Under the policy, float grading using water flotation is only one acceptable method of determining floaters to exclude from production to count. To clarify and specifically address the commenter's concern regarding industry practices, FCIC has specifically added to the definition of wet in-shell, through the component definition of floaters, a reference that laboratory testing for floater determination is also acceptable as an alternative to float grading using water floatation. In sum, FCIC requires that the reported production must not include floaters and peewees, or, in other words, the weight of the trash, which the industry and FCIC now similarly define. \\nIn the proposed rule, FCIC proposed to define the terms \\u201cfloaters\\u201d and \\u201cpeewees\\u201d because those terms are used in the Special Provisions statement and LASH definitions that were proposed for incorporation into the \\u201cwet in-shell\\u201d definition. Those terms were not previously defined within the Crop Provisions, but they were defined in the Macadamia Nut LASH. The LASH has contained those terms and their definitions since the 2005 crop year. \\nThe proposed rule comment period is an opportunity for the public to provide input on changes FCIC proposes to make to the Crop Provisions. Interested parties are permitted to provide comments during that time. If the commenter had specific suggestions for recommended changes to this portion of the Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions, the commenter had an opportunity to provide specific proposed changes on this issue during the proposed rule comment period. However, FCIC has made an addition to the definition that will address the commenter's industry concern. \\nComment: One commenter recommends deleting the comma in the phrase \\u201cwet, in-shell pounds\\u201d in the definition of \\u201cproduction guarantee (per acre)\\u201d to match the defined term of \\u201cwet in-shell,\\u201d as was done in sections 6(d) and 11(c). \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that the comma should be removed from the sentence. The comma is not necessary and its removal does not change the meaning of the provision. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly. \\nComment: One commenter recommends adding a comma before the added phrase \\u201c. . . excluding floaters and peewees . . .\\u201d in the definition of \\u201cwet in-shell.\\u201d \\nResponse: FCIC disagrees with the commenter. A comma would not add clarity. \\nSection 2 \\nComment: One commenter states if the current paragraph (a) is deleted as proposed, then Basic Provisions section 34(b)(1) will apply, meaning optional units will require a clear and discernible break, and acceptable and verifiable records. The commenter has no objection to this change. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that by deleting paragraph (a) of the Macadamia Tree Crop Provisions, section 34(b)(1) of the Basic Provisions will apply. FCIC thanks the commenter for its support. \\nComment: One commenter states that the first sentence in section 2 states that optional units by legal description or by irrigated/non-irrigated practices are not applicable; and the second sentence states that \\u201c. . . Optional units may be established ONLY if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement\\u201d [emphasis added]. The commenter states that neither sentence addresses the possibility of optional units for organic and conventional practices, which is allowed according to section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. As written, this provision appears to mean that separate optional units for organic and conventional acreage would be possible only if they happen to be on non-contiguous land or unless allowed by written agreement. If that is the intention, it would be clearer to include \\u201corganic practices\\u201d in the first sentence as not applicable. If it is not intended to exclude optional units by organic/conventional practices, the second sentence should be revised to clarify that optional units by non-contiguous land may be \\u201cin addition to\\u201d the optional units by organic/conventional allowed in section 34(c)(3) of the Basic Provisions. \\nResponse: FCIC intends for optional units to be allowed on acreage located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice. FCIC does not intend to require that optional units distinguished by organic and conventional practices must also be located on non-contiguous land. FCIC has revised the provisions accordingly. \\nComment: One commenter states the \\u201cBackground\\u201d explains that the proposal to remove the 80-acre minimum requirement for optional units is because most macadamia tree orchards are smaller than that, and the other proposed changes (requiring a clear and discernible break, and records) \\u201c. . . will mitigate any potential abuse from this change.\\u201d The commenter has no objection to this change. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter and thanks it for its support. \\nSection 3 \\nComment: One commenter recommends shifting the following phrase in paragraph (b): \\u201c. . . on the yield potential of the insured crop\\u201d from the end of the first sentence to be ahead of the list, so it would read: \\u201c. . . based on our estimate of the effect on the yield potential of the insured crop of the following: Interplanted perennial crop; removal of trees; damage; change in practices and any other circumstance. If you fail . . .\\u201d \\nResponse: Given that no change to this provision was proposed, and the public was not provided an opportunity to comment, FCIC declines to adopt the recommendation in the final rule. In addition, this language is consistent with other Crop Provisions, such as Texas Citrus Fruit and Arizona-California Citrus. No change has been made. \\nComment: One commenter recommends revising the following sentence in paragraph (d), \\u201cEach crop year you must report your production from two crop years ago . . .\\u201d to \\u201c. . . from two crop years before . . .\\u201d \\nResponse: Given that no change to this provision was proposed, and the public was not provided an opportunity to comment, FCIC declines to adopt the recommendation in the final rule. In addition, this language is consistent with other Crop Provisions, such as Texas Citrus Fruit and Arizona-California Citrus. No change has been made. \\nSection 6 \\nComment: One commenter agrees the wording change from \\u201c. . . we may agree in writing . . .\\u201d to \\u201c. . . we may give our approval in writing . . .\\u201d in paragraph (d) makes it less likely for this to be taken as a reference to a written agreement. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter and thanks it for its support. \\nComment: One commenter states the second sentence in paragraph (d) sounds a bit odd when it refers to \\u201c. . . approval in writing to insure ACREAGE that has not yet reached this age . . .\\u201d, referring to the requirement in the first sentence that the insured crop be \\u201c. . . grown on TREES that have reached at least the fifth growing season . . .\\u201d Since the second sentence goes on to say coverage on this under-age acreage can be approved \\u201c. . . if IT has produced at least 200 pounds of (wet in-shell) macadamia nuts per ACRE in a previous crop year\\u201d, maybe the word \\u201cacreage\\u201d is correct and no change is needed. But one possible alternative to consider might be: \\u201c. . . to insure acreage of trees that have not reached this age . . .\\u201d \\nResponse: Given that no change to this provision was proposed, and the public was not provided an opportunity to comment, FCIC declines to adopt the recommendation in the final rule. In addition, the original Macadamia Nut Crop Provisions are written with this language because nut production, not nut trees, is insured under these particular Crop Provisions. No change has been made. \\nSection 8 \\nComment: One commenter states the proposal is to add the phrase \\u201cor as specified in the Special Provisions\\u201d to paragraph (a)(2), so paragraph (a)(2) would read as follows: \\u201cThe calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is the second June 30th after insurance attaches, or as specified in the Special Provisions.\\u201d According to the \\u201cBackground\\u201d, this \\u201c. . . will provide flexibility to update this date if the need arises.\\u201d The commenter does not object to providing flexibility to make the program work better, though it can also add some complexity by making the calendar date subject to change, meaning it must be looked up in the Special Provisions for the applicable county to be certain the date is unchanged. \\nResponse: FCIC agrees with the commenter that the added phrase provides flexibility to make the program work better. This flexibility eliminates the administrative burden of revising the regulation if FCIC determines the calendar date for the end of insurance period should be different than what is stated in the Crop Provisions. In addition, the change does not add the complexity issue raised by the commenter because a policyholder must always read the Special Provisions to ensure it is aware of any changes to any issue covered by the Special Provisions, which may extend beyond changes to the end of the insurance period. No change has been made. \\nList of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 457 \\nCrop insurance, Macadamia tree and macadamia nut, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. \\nFinal Rule \\nAccordingly, as set forth in the preamble, the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation amends 7 CFR part 457 effective for the 2016 and succeeding crop years for macadamia trees and for the 2017 and succeeding crop years for macadamia nuts as follows: \\nPART 457\\u2014COMMON CROP INSURANCE REGULATIONS \\n1. The authority citation for 7 CFR part 457 continues to read as follows: \\nAuthority: \\n7 U.S.C. 1506(1) and 1506(o). \\n2. Amend \\xa7 457.130 as follows: \\na. In the introductory text by removing \\u201c2011\\u201d and adding \\u201c2016\\u201d in its place; \\nb. In section 1 by adding in alphabetical order definitions of \\u201cDamaged\\u201d and \\u201cScaffold limb\\u201d; \\nc. By revising section 2; \\nd.

In section 6 introductory text by removing the phrase \\u201c(Insured Crop)\\u201d; \\nh. In section 7 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Insurable Acreage) of the Basic Provisions (\\xa7 457.8), that prohibit\\u201d and adding in its place the phrase \\u201cof the Basic Provisions (\\xa7 457.8) that prohibit\\u201d; \\ni. In section 8 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Insurance Period)\\u201d in paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b) introductory text; \\nj. In section 9 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Causes of Loss)\\u201d in paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b) introductory text; \\nk. By revising section 10; and \\nl. In section 11: \\ni. By revising paragraph (b)(3); \\nii. By redesignating paragraph (b)(4) as paragraph (b)(5); \\niii. By adding paragraph (b)(4); and \\niv. By revising newly redesignated paragraph (b)(5) and paragraphs (c) introductory text and (c)(1). \\nThe revisions and additions read as follows: \\n\\xa7 457.130 \\n1. Definitions \\nDamaged. Injury to the main trunk, scaffold limb(s), and any other subordinate limbs that reduces the productivity of the macadamia tree due to an insured cause of loss that occurs during the insurance period. \\nScaffold limb. A major limb attached directly to the trunk. \\n2. Unit Division \\n(a) Provisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement. \\n(b) You must have provided records, which can be independently verified, of acreage and age of trees for each unit for at least the last crop year. \\n10. Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss \\nIn addition to the requirements of section 14 of the Basic Provisions, in case of damage or probable loss, if you intend to claim an indemnity on any unit, you must allow us to inspect all insured acreage before pruning any damaged trees, removing any damaged trees, or removing any destroyed trees. \\n11. Settlement of Claim \\n(b) * * * \\n(3) Determine the applicable percent of loss, which is calculated as follows: \\n(i) Subtract the coverage level percent you elected from 100 percent; \\n(ii) Determine the actual percent of loss, which is determined as follows: \\n(A) Divide the number of trees destroyed by the total number of trees to calculate the percent loss; \\n(B) Divide the number of trees damaged by the total number of trees to calculate the percent of damage; \\n(C) Add the results of sections 11(b)(3)(ii)(A) and (B). \\n(iii) Subtract the result obtained in section 11(b)(3)(i) from section 11(b)(3)(ii); \\n(iv) Divide the result in section 11(b)(3)(iii) by the coverage level you elected (For example, if you elected the 75 percent coverage level and your actual percent of loss was 70 percent, the percent of loss specified in section 11(b)(3) would be calculated as follows: 100%\\u221275% = 25%; 70%\\u221225% = 45%; 45% \\xf7 75% = 60%.); \\n(4) Multiply the result of section 11(b)(3) by the total dollar amount of insurance obtained in section 11(b)(2); and \\n(5) Multiply the result in section 11(b)(4) by your share. \\nFor example: \\nYou select 65 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the price election on 10 acres of 9-year-old macadamia trees in the unit. Your share is 100 percent. The amount of insurance per acre is $5,850. There are 90 trees per unit. Thirty-five trees are destroyed. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows: \\n(1) 10 acres \\xd7 $5,850 = $58,500; \\n(3)(i) 100 percent \\u2212 65 percent = 35 percent deductible; \\n(ii) 35 destroyed trees \\xf7 90 total unit trees = 38.9 percent loss; \\n(iii) 38.9 percent loss \\u2212 35 percent deductible = 3.9 percent; \\n(iv) 3.9 percent \\xf7 65 percent coverage level = 6.0 percent loss; \\n(4) $58,500 total amount of insurance \\xd7 6.0 percent loss = $3,510 loss; and \\n(5) $3,510 loss \\xd7 100 percent share = $3,510 indemnity payment. \\n(c) The total amount of loss will include both damaged trees and destroyed trees as follows: \\n(1) Any orchard with over 80 percent of the actual trees damaged or destroyed due to an insured cause of loss will be considered to be 100 percent damaged; and \\n3. Amend \\xa7 457.131 as follows: \\na. In the introductory text by removing \\u201c2012\\u201d and adding \\u201c2017\\u201d in its place; \\nb. In section 1: \\ni. By adding definitions in alphabetical order of \\u201cFloaters\\u201d and \\u201cPeewees\\u201d; and \\nii. By revising the definition of \\u201cWet in-shell\\u201d; \\nc. By revising section 2; \\nd. In section 3: \\ni. In the introductory text and paragraph (b) introductory text by removing the phrase \\u201c(Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities)\\u201d; \\nii. In paragraph (b)(4) introductory text by removing the word \\u201canytime\\u201d and adding in its place the phrase \\u201cany time\\u201d; and \\niii. By revising paragraph (d); \\ne. In section 4 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Contract Changes)\\u201d; \\nf. In section 5 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Life of Policy, Cancellation, and Termination)\\u201d; \\ng. In section 6: \\ni. By removing the phrase \\u201c(Insured Crop)\\u201d in the introductory text; and \\nii. By revising paragraph (d); \\nh. In section 7: \\ni. By removing the phrase \\u201c(Insurable Acreage)\\u201d; and \\nii. By removing the comma after the phrase \\u201cBasic Provisions (\\xa7 457.8)\\u201d; \\ni. In section 8: \\ni. By removing the phrase \\u201c(Insurance Period)\\u201d in paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b) introductory text; and \\nii. By revising paragraph (a)(2); \\nj. In section 9 by removing the phrase \\u201c(Causes of Loss)\\u201d in paragraphs (a) introductory text and (b) introductory text; \\nk. In section 10 introductory text by removing the phrase \\u201c(Duties in the Event of Damage or Loss)\\u201d; \\nl. In section 11: \\ni. In paragraph (b)(4) by removing the phrase \\u201cif applicable, (see section 11(c))\\u201d and adding in its place the phrase \\u201cif applicable (see section 11(c)),\\u201d; \\nii. By adding a settlement of claim example after paragraph (b)(7); and \\niii. In paragraph (c) by removing the phrase \\u201c(wet, in-shell pounds)\\u201d and adding in its place the phrase \\u201c(wet in-shell pounds)\\u201d. \\nThe revisions and additions read as follows: \\n\\xa7 457.131 \\n1. Definitions \\nFloaters. Inedible, husked \\u201cfield run\\u201d nuts identified by water flotation or laboratory testing. \\nPeewees. Mature and immature wet in-shell nuts that are smaller than 16 mm (5/8 inch) in diameter. \\nWet in-shell. The weight of the macadamia nuts as they are removed from the orchard with the nut meats in the shells after removal of the husk and excluding floaters and peewees but prior to being dried. \\n2. Unit Division \\nProvisions in the Basic Provisions that allow optional units by section, section equivalent, or FSA farm serial number and by irrigated and non-irrigated practices are not applicable. Optional units may be established only if each optional unit is located on non-contiguous land or grown and insured under an organic farming practice, unless otherwise allowed by written agreement. \\n3. Insurance Guarantees, Coverage Levels, and Prices for Determining Indemnities \\n(d) Instead of reporting your macadamia nut production for the previous crop year, as required by section 3 of the Basic Provisions, there is a one-year lag period. Each crop year you must report your production from two crop years ago, e.g., on the 2016 crop year production report, you will provide your 2014 crop year production. \\n6. Insured Crop \\n(d) That are grown on trees that have reached at least the fifth growing season after being set out or grafted. However, we may give our approval in writing to insure acreage of trees that has not reached this age if it has produced at least 200 pounds of (wet in-shell) macadamia nuts per acre in a previous crop year; and \\n8. Insurance Period \\n(a) * * * \\n(2) The calendar date for the end of the insurance period for each crop year is the second June 30th after insurance attaches, or as specified in the Special Provisions. \\n11. Settlement of Claim \\n(b) * * * \\n(7) * * * \\nFor example: \\nYou select the 65 percent coverage level and 100 percent of the price election on 10 acres of macadamia nuts in the unit. Your share is 100 percent. Your production guarantee (per acre) is 4,000 pounds. The price election is $0.78. You are able to harvest 25,000 pounds. Your indemnity would be calculated as follows: \\n(1) 10 acres \\xd7 4,000 pounds = 40,000 pounds guarantee; \\n(2) 40,000 pounds \\xd7 $0.78 price election = $31,200 total value of guarantee; \\n(4) 25,000 pounds production to count \\xd7 $0.78 price election = $19,500 value of production to count; \\n(6) $31,200 total value of guarantee \\u2212 $19,500 value of production to count = $11,700 loss; and \\n(7) $11,700 loss \\xd7 100 percent share = $11,700 indemnity payment. \\nSigned in Washington, DC, on April 9, 2015. \\nBrandon Willis, \\nManager, Federal Crop Insurance Corporation. \\n[FR Doc. 2015-08690 Filed 4-15-15; 8:45 am] \\nBILLING CODE 3410-08-P \\n\",\n",
